Description: Northwestern University Knight Lab (@knightlab) created a SQL murder mystery to
    help beginners and experienced SQL learners to sharpen their SQL skills through solving the 
    crime that happened at SQL City. This package loads the data for you to similarly
    solve the mystery using R tools in order to learn. The README file is particular to
    the tidyverse tools that can aid in solving the mystery but please feel free to pick
    a learning path and try using that tool - perhaps you want to learn data.table, or base R, 
    try it and if you'd like consider submitting a "cheatsheet" for that tool!
